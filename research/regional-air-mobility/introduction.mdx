This project develops methods to assess the impact of regional air mobility (RAM) on overburdened regions nationwide. We present a framework combining aircraft design and door-to-door air transportation analysis. The framework will be applied to perform a comprehensive feasibility assessment of RAM in rural Appalachia from a geographic, operational, and socio-economic standpoint.
