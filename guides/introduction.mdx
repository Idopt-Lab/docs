At the IDOpt lab, we work on **advancing the science and practice of engineering design**. We aim to improve how complex engineering systems are conceived, analyzed, and optimized.

Aircraft are prime examples of complex engineering systems. Their design is shaped by their missions and the environments in which they operate. Aircraft design requires consideration of multiple disciplines—such as aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and controls—and the coupled analysis of these disciplines to evaluate overall performance. As safety-critical systems, aircraft must meet rigorous regulatory certification standards and demonstrate high reliability across all components.

At the IDOpt lab, we develop methods, algorithms, and software to address such challenges.
